## Overview
We develop theoretical and numerical models to investigate protoplanetary disk evolution, planet formation, and the multiscale multiphysics involved and to compliment existing and forthcoming astronomical observations.


## Areas of Interest
- [**Protoplanetary Disks**](/research/protoplanetary-disks/)
- [**Planet Formation**](/research/planet-formation/)
- [**Fluid Dynamics**](/research/fluid-dynamics/)


## Software Development
In addition to designing and employing large-scale numerical simulations to both understand dynamical processes and compare with observations, we develop and contribute to the following widely-used, open-source astrophysical codes:
- [**Athena**](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/Athena-Cversion/){:target="_blank"}: grid-based code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
- [**Athena++**](https://www.athena-astro.app/){:target="_blank"}: GRMHD code with mesh refinement
- [**Pencil Code**](http://pencil-code.nordita.org/){:target="_blank"}: high-order finite-difference code for compressible hydrodynamic flows with magnetic fields

## Funding
